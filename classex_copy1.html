    <p><i>He come to me with money in his hand
        He offered me, I didn't ask him
        I wasn't knocking someone's door down, I was running from that
        When I got out, I was in that
        I was already through that, I had that
        I had the studio, I went to the studio
        I went to Vox Studios. I had it all, and I looked at it and said, 'This is a bigger jail than I just got out of.'
        I don't want to take my time going to work
        I got a motorcycle and a sleeping bag
        And ten or fifteen girls
        What the hell I wanna go off into -- and go to work for?
        Work for what, money? I got all the money in the world
        I'm the king, man
        I run the underworld, guy
        I decide whos does what and where they do it at
        What am I, gonna run around and act like I'm some teenybopper somewhere, for somebody else's money?
        I make the money, man, I roll the nickels
        The game is mine
        I deal the cards
        <strong>(Beware, God is watching)</strong></i></p>
