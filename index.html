<p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
  I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
  She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
  In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
  Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
  Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
  Didn't make sense not to live for fun
  Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
  So much to do, so much to see
  So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
  You'll never know if you don't go
  You'll never shine if you don't glow
  Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
  Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
  And all that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars break the mold
  It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
  You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
  But the meteor men beg to differ
  Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
  The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
  The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
  My world's on fire, how about yours?
  That's the way I like it and I never get bored
  Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
  Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
  All that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars break the mold
  Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
  Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
  And all that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars
  Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
  I need to get myself away from this place
  I said yep what a concept
  I could use a little fuel myself
  And we could all use a little change
  Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
  Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
  Didn't make sense not to live for fun
  Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
  So much to do, so much to see
  So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
  You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
  You'll never shine if you don't glow
  Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
  Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
  And all that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars break the mold
  And all that glitters is gold
  Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
